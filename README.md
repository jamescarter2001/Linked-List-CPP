# Linked-List++

Demo program on how to implement a linked list using C++ syntax. This does pretty much the same thing as the C version so check [that one](https://github.com/jamescarter2001/Linked-List) out for details on pointers, structures etc. as the same knowledge can be applied here.

## Basic C++ Syntax

td::cout outputs information to the user. For example, std::cout << "Hello"; will print "Hello" on the screen the same way printf("Hello"); would in C. In addition, variables can also be printed within the same of code. For example, if we have a variable called "x" with a value of 5, std::cout << "Value: " << x; will give the output "Value: 5". Format specifiers are not necessary in C++.

std::cin takes in user input. For example if we want the user to enter a number and store it in variable x, we would use std::cin >> x;

"<<" is used when we are specifying that data is going into a std C++ function.
">>" is used when we are specifying that we are getting data from a std C++ function.

This only applies to native C++ functions, normal function calls such as add(2, 5); are handled the same as in C.
